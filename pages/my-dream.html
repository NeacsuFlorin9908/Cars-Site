                    <p>For decades the Mercedes S-Class has been the go-to luxury limo for fat-cat CEOs, high-ranking
                        European officials and
                        anyone else looking for maximum luxury in a discrete wrapper.
                        Every generation has pushed the boundaries of both luxury and technology - the S-Class was the
                        first
                        car to feature
                        modern four-channel anti-lock brakes and adaptive cruise control - and the new one is no
                        different,
                        though you might
                        have to look close to spot the slimmer headlights and retractable door handles that mark it out
                        from
                        the old car.</p>

                    <p>Love it or hate it, BMW's controversial styling is here to stay. The grilles keep getting bigger,
                        the
                        headlights keep
                        getting weirder, and yet the brand's sales remain strong. This time around, it's the big X7
                        SUV's
                        turn for facial
                        surgery. The 2023 model has an updated look meant to bring it in line with the new-generation
                        7-series sedan, and it's
                        polarizing. There's more to the new X7 than revised front- and rear-end designs, however, as the
                        model also sees
                        upgraded engines, a spruced-up interior, and several new standard and optional features.</p>

                    <p>The Ford Mustang has been one of America's most popular sport coupes for half a century, and it
                        was
                        identified as a
                        future classic from the day it launched. Ford built plenty of Mustangs, and there are survivors
                        from
                        nearly all
                        generations, though the 1970s models were not highly valued and many went to the crusher.
                        When considering an older Mustang, it is important to check VIN, engine ID, and fender tags to
                        verify originality. Many
                        older low-end six-cylinder Mustangs were repowered with V-8 engines, and while it's fine to buy
                        one
                        of these, keep in
                        mind they should not command prices (and will not hold their value) like a factory-built
                        high-performance variant. Very
                        rare, valuable, and limited-run cars should be authenticated by a Mustang expert before
                        purchase.
