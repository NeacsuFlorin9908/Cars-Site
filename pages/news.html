            </ul>
            <p>You no longer need a massive engine to get massive horsepower, as proven by the Rimac Nevera. Thanks to a
                120kWh battery
                and four electric motors, this insane car has 1,914hp and 2,300Nm of torque.
                It’s much more than just tear-your-face-off fast though, it’s a beautiful place to sit as well. All the
                interior parts
                are bespoke to the Nevera and crafted from high quality leather and carbon fibre.

            <h1>Bugatti Chiron Super Sport (1,600hp)</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>0-60mph: 2.4 seconds</li>

            </ul>
            <p>When you think of horsepower, you probably think of Bugatti and the 1,000hp Veyron from the early
                noughties. Well
                they’ve come a long way since then, and the latest Bugatti Chiron has 1,600hp.
                As if an 8.0-litre W16 engine wasn’t enough, Bugatti decided what it really needed was four
                turbochargers strapping to
                it. What’s really insane however is the way you can catapult from 0-60mph in 2.4 seconds whilst sitting
                in palatial
                luxury.

                <li>Engine: 5.0-litre V8 + 3 electric motors</li>
                <li>Top speed: 250mph</li>
                <li>Price: £1.5m</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you combine a 5.0-litre V8 engine with three electric motors, the results are always going to be
                pretty potent.
                Almost 1,500hp is enough to shoot the Regera from 0-249mph in just over 31 seconds.
                It also has no traditional gearbox, favouring a unique system called Koenigsegg Direct Drive which is
                essentially just a
                torque converter in place of a gearbox. You get automatic opening for all the doors on the car, as well
                as a very nicely
                finished interior.

            <p>You may not be expecting to see a four-door saloon car on this list, and yet here we are. The Tesla Model
                S Plaid is a
                car you can use to scare supercar owners, and take the family along for the ride.
                It’s also packed with tech to make daily driving less stressful, although the ‘yoke’ steering wheel may
                undo some of
                that serenity when it comes to manoeuvring. It’s a modern looking car though, both inside and out.

            </ul>
            <p>The Dodge Demon really does prove that there’s no replacement for displacement. It was designed with drag
                racing in mind
                , and as such didn’t come with a passenger seat as standard. You also need to put 100 octane race fuel
                in to get the
                full 840hp, otherwise you have to make do with “just” 808hp.
                If you take your drag racing seriously, you could also have the ‘Demon Crate’. This was a box which
                included a handful
                of tools, as well as skinny drag wheels for the front, a performance air filter, a new ECU and a
                replacement dash panel
                with a high-octane fuel switch.

            </ul>
            <p>You can’t really talk about high horsepower without mentioning a V12 Ferrari, and the 812 Superfast is a
                pretty special
                one (which it ought to be with a name like that). You can really stretch the legs of that V12, all the
                way to 9,000rpm,
                and it sounds pretty incredible when you do.
                It’s not just the raw power that makes the 812 so impressive. The fact it’s so comfortable and easy to
                tame, unlike its
                predecessor the F12, is truly remarkable. The cabin also manages to be a combination of stripped back
                and luxurious at
                the same time, which is an impressive feat.

            </ul>
            <p>Another unlikely candidate for a high-horsepower hero, the Rivian R1T is an all-electric pickup truck.
                The top speed may
                not be anything to write home about, however the power and torque more than makes up for this in
                acceleration.
                The R1T is also packed with clever features, such as a portable speaker under the seat and a
                rechargeable torch in the
                door card. You can also specify a camping kitchen which slides out of the side in case you fancy taking

            <p>Back to the mental supercars, the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ is one of the final versions of the brand’s
                flagship. It’s
                sporting some fairly old tech, such as the single-clutch robotized manual gearbox which can be very
                jerky at low speeds.
                Ignore this though, and you can appreciate that stunning V12 soundtrack and the fact that it’s far less
                intimidating to
                drive quickly than you’d expect. In true Lambo fashion, it’s also outrageous to look at with its massive
                rear wind and
                aggressive body kit.

            <p>McLaren’s naming strategy is pretty straight forward, the 765 LT has 765hp, however that’s about the only

                this car which is simple. It’s rammed full of technology to make it as fast as possible on the
                racetrack.
                You can adjust what angle you’d like to drift at on the screen, as an example, and there’s an active
                suspension setup to
                further improve cornering. The exhaust is made of titanium to save weight, and even the wheels have been

                to be nimble
                and responsive despite weighing over 2.2 tons.
                If the saloon body shell is a touch impractical for you, you can have a gorgeous looking estate version
